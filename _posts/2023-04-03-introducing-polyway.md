Hey fellow 3D artists!

I'm excited to share with you my latest project, **Polyway**, a platform created to help 3D artists receive fair pay and achieve better treatment from their employers. We noticed that unlike other professionals, 3D artists often lacked access to up-to-date salary data and resources for career growth.

With Polyway, we want to change that. Here's what you can expect:

<!--more-->

- ðŸ“Š **Salary Database:** Compare your salary with others in the industry using our comprehensive database compiled from DOL LCA disclosure data and submissions from industry professionals.

- ðŸŽ¤ **Interview Help Service:** Prepping for a big interview? Use our service to instantly generate potential questions you may be asked and be better prepared for your interview. (Yes, it is GPT-powered)

- ðŸŒŸ **Portfolio Reviews:** Get expert feedback on your portfolio from industry professionals to help you improve and showcase your best work.

Polyway was built for 3D artists and we're committed to empowering our community. We'd love for you to join us on our journey, contribute your salary data, and benefit from the resources we offer.
